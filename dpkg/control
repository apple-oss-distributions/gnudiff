Description: Diff utilities
 Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ.
 Diffutils provides tools for presenting and managing changes.
 .
 The "diff" command shows differences between two files, or each
 corresponding file in two directories. The "diff3" command shows
 differences among three files--an original and two changed
 versions--and can produce a merged file that contains both sets of
 changes together with warnings about conflicts. The "sdiff" command
 merges two files interactively.
